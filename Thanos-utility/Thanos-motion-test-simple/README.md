This is a simple processing schetch with a single slider that will allow you to test the motion of the actuators using a slider.

The Thanos controller is automatically identified and the connection is enabled to it as soon the program runs. 
You may need to disconnect other USB devices from the computer, a message prompting you to do so may appear.

To Run it you will need to download Processing from here:
